<h1>Group Exercise 1</h1>
<ul>
<li>Decide in your team on some habit or behaviour that you each share (more or less) and would like to change.</li>
<li>Think of examples in the past where you have tried to change your own behaviour:
<ul>
<li>cases where you have succeeded, and</li>
<li>cases where you have failed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Using this background material, come up with one or more scenarios which illustrate some of the barriers to change that have emerged in your discussion.</li>
<li>Create characters based on yourself to inhabit these scenarios.</li>
<li>Develop a role-play to highlight these scenarios.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Group Exercise 2</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>What did you learn</p></li>
<li>Be clear about your goals</li>
<li>Prepare 4 questions to elicit qualitative data, e.g.
<ul>
<li>explanations</li>
<li>interpretations</li>
<li>experiences</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Identify time slot, space</li>
<li>Recruit 5 participants</li>

<h1>Activities</h1>
<p>During Friday’s session, each team will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Revisit planning decisions for the focus group: how did those work out?</li>
<li>Review/discuss focus group audio/video and do some quick analysis (I will give additional instructions and handouts in class!)</li>
<li>Generate a few preliminary “findings” for each discussion question and report these back to the class</li>
</ul>
<p>Most teams will need to spend some additional time on analysis outside this session, but this session should give you a good start.</p>
</section><section id="for-friday" class="slide level2">
<h1>For Friday</h1>
<p>For Friday, your team will need to bring:</p>
<ul>
<li>AT LEAST ONE password-protected laptop, already loaded up with the focus group video and/or audio. Please check audio/video playback ahead of time, make sure it works.</li>
<li>Copies of your focus group goals and questions &amp;mdash; you may want multiple copies to write on.</li>
<li>Your note-taker’s notes from the session
<ul>
<li>you may want to photocopy these so different team members can look at them at the same time, write on them, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Writing materials</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="before-friday" class="slide level2">
<h1>Before Friday</h1>
<p>your team should have done the following: * Finished your focus group and gotten audio/video files off the recording devices * Backed up audio/video files to DataStore * Written down quick impressions of how the focus group went, what actually got done in the session time, any problems. This could be done individually or as a team. * Any team members not present during the focus group should have reviewed the audio/video, and spoken to the other team members about how things went. No one should be seeing the focus group content for the first time on the analysis day!</p>
</section><section id="ethics-paperwork" class="slide level2">
<h1>Ethics paperwork</h1>
<ul>
<li>Please also bring your signed consent forms from the focus group, to be handed in to Ewan for secure storage (per the terms of the ethical approval for the DDS course).</li>
<li>Check if you need to record any of this information in a (password-protected) document or spreadsheet before handing over the forms. This likely only applies to teams who added extra information fields on the consent</li>
