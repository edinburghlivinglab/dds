# Just Writing (10.00-10.15)

## Today's Prompts

5 mins today!

1. Which do I prefer: talking or listening?
2. What makes a team work well?

## Why are we doing this?

* What's the point of writing if you don't write well? (Content, idea generaion, writing 'muscle')
* What happens if you let your hand stop? (You look back, and you start **editing**.)
* How is it different from the way you usually write?
* What happens when you find it hard to keep going?
* What happens when time is up?
* What happens if you review past sessions? What themes, ideas, patterns start to emerge? But keep some distance, don't do it too soon.

## Why are we doing this?

* When you set your own prompts, try to decide what is the 'next frontier' for your own research.
* Begin before you begin. (Not a first draft.)


What I don't understand
Where is this taking me
What is the next question?
Where do I find that out?
