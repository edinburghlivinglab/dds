# Just Writing (10.00-10.15)

## Today's Prompts

5 mins today!

1. 
2. 

## Why are we doing this?

1. You need a **prompt** -- we'll give you a couple initially.
1. Select prompt, write it as the first thing on the page.
2. Keep your hand moving on the page until time is up. Doesn't need to be fast. Don't stop until time is up! 
2. Stay focussed on the prompt, but if you feel you are getting stuck, try the other prompt.
3. You don't need to write well. You don't need to like what you've written.
4. You're not allowed to show this writing to anyone else.
