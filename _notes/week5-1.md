## Group Exercise 

<!-- * Decide in your team on some habit or behaviour that you each share (more or less) and would like to change.
* Think of examples in the past where you have tried to change your own behaviour:
    - cases where you have succeeded, and
    - cases where you have failed.
* Using this background material, come up with one or more scenarios which  illustrate some of the barriers to change that have emerged in your discussion. 
* Create characters based on yourself to inhabit these scenarios.
* Develop a role-play to highlight these scenarios.

## Group Exercise 2

* What did you learn

* Be clear about your goals
* Prepare 4 questions to elicit qualitative data, e.g.
    - explanations
    - interpretations
    - experiences
* Identify time slot, space
* Recruit 5 participants
* Assign team roles
* Book equipment -->


# Slow Hack

## Where we are

* Coming to the end of **Digging Deeper** Phase
* ILW starts 15th Feb
* [Slow Hack](https://edinburghlivinglab.github.io/dds/slow_hack/) starts the week after ILW (22nd Feb)

## Focus

By the start of Slow Hack, you should have decided on:

* a specific problem / challenge within your sub-theme; and
* a specific design idea which addresses that problem.

But the design idea needs to be explored, tested, modified, iterated throughout the Slow Hack.

## Using Data

* Use both **subjective** and **objective** data. 
* Use some **existing** data and **collect** some new data. 


## Using Data &mdash; options


&nbsp;      Existing   Collected
----------  --------   ---------
Subjective     X
Objective                  X

&nbsp;      Existing   Collected

Objective       X


## What Counts as Success?

* You are looking at complex and difficult issues &mdash; there is no one "right answer".
* You should try to develop a **proof-of-concept**. This is a demonstration of feasibility, something that could potentially make a positive difference.
* Your approach is as important as the outcome.

## What Counts as Success?

In a nutshell:

1. Propose a design-based solution to a current problem within sub-theme
1. Effectively communicate your problem and design idea
1. Engage in ongoing reflection and justification
1. Demonstrate consistent participation and professional working

## Anti-Success

You do not:

* have to please us, or do what you think we would like;
* have "signficant" results &mdash; remember it's only a proof-of-concept;
* have to have "the right answer".

# Friday data analysis session

## During Friday

During Friday's session, each team will:

* Revisit planning decisions for the focus group &mdash; how did those work out?
* Review/discuss focus group audio/video and do some quick analysis.
	- Additional instructions and handouts will be given in class!
* Generate a few preliminary “findings” for each discussion question and report these back to the class

Most teams will need to spend additional time on analysis outside this session, but it should give you a good start. 

## For Friday 

For Friday, your team will need to bring:

* **At least one** password-protected laptop, already loaded up with the focus group video and/or audio. (*Please check audio/video playback ahead of time, make sure it works.*)
* Copies of your focus group goals and questions &mdash; you may want multiple copies to write on.
* Your note-taker's notes from the session. (*You may want to photocopy these so different team members can look at them at the same time.*)
* Writing materials

## Before Friday, 1

Before Friday, your team should have done the following:

* Finished your focus group and gotten audio/video files off the recording devices.
* Backed up audio/video files to DataStore.
* Written down quick impressions of how the focus group went, what actually got done in the session time, any problems. 
	- This could be done individually or as a team.


## Before Friday, 2

* Any team members not present during the focus group should have reviewed the audio/video, and spoken to the other team members about how things went. 
* No one should be seeing the focus group content for the first time on the analysis day!

## Ethics paperwork

* Please also bring your signed consent forms from the focus group, to be handed in to Ewan for secure storage (as per the terms of the ethical approval for the DDS course). 
* Check if you need to record any of this information in a (password-protected) document or spreadsheet before handing over the forms. This likely only applies to teams who added extra information fields on the consent form.
