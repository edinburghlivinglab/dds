# Course Intro

## Quick Course Overview

<div class="notes">
* 15 mins
* EK

</div>

Very quick overview of the course. This will focus on the **what**, not the why or the how.

* projects
* theme and sub-themes
* teams
* hack structure

---

# Four Rules

* Turn up and be fully present --- class time is essential
* Do every exercise and piece of work when it comes up --- you can't cram the material in during last week of semester
* Be reliable --- your team members will depend on you
* If in doubt, ask in class or see Alyssa

# Example projects from Design for Informatics (D4I)

<div class="notes">
* 10 mins
* AA

## D4I

* D4I is Masters course organised on similar principles to DDS
* Projects can illustrate what's possible
* D4I Theme: promote walking in the centre of Edinburgh

---

## Walkabus

* Challenge: Encourage more active travel by people who commute by bus into the city centre 
* Idea: Offer a financial incentive (special cheaper bus ticket) for them to get off the bus early and replace part of their journey with walking. 
* Goal: Alter people’s existing travel habits, rather than create entirely new ones.

## Umbrella4Everyone

* Challenge: Reduce the extent that poor weather dissuades people from walking (versus using buses, taxis, etc.) 
* Idea: Propose a network of umbrella vending machines around the city centre
   * Users could borrow an umbrella whenever they needed one -- free of charge as long as the umbrella was returned on time to another point. 
   * Similar to a “Boris Bikes” for umbrellas.

Fewer pictures than Walkabus but does have some project description.

## Only 'proof of concept'

* Both project websites lead reader to believe that they already have live apps and a functioning service. 
* This is not true —-- both apps are mock-ups!
* E.g. umbrella vending machine was some umbrellas in a cardboard box made to look like a vending machine. 

Projects to not need to build complete apps or fancy equipment in order to show “proof of concept”. 

* DDS is the same in terms of how complete teams’ ideas need to be. The goal is “proof of concept”, not having complete solutions or products.

## Two other D4I Projects

## FlowED
A city-wide, scavenger-hunt style game targeted at Edinburgh residents. The goal is to encourage people to explore and enjoy their own city via walking, especially taking little-known streets and routes.

This group does have a live app for you to download and try!

---

## Footable

Aimed to encourage walking by translating food and drink consumption into walking times. For example, did you know it would take you 52 minutes to walk off the calories in a pint of beer? 

This project had a “public service announcement” style poster campaign, and mocked up an app that would translate food items into walking distances.
