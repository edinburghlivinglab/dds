# Just Writing

## Today's Prompts

1. The priorities this week for my DDS team are ...
2. The things that I really want to do this week are ...

# Visualisation and Advocacy

## Overview

* **Engage**: get attention through a memorable image
* **Communicate an argument**: summarise concepts through a design
* **Draw the viewer in**: give them a way to explore the issue further

## Getting People to Care

* Need to develop communities that care about something
* Understand existing, shared values and beliefs
* Instill new values and beliefs
* Effective visual campaign:
	* current facts and problem
	* implied promise for the future
	* implied justification for change



# Visual Techniques

## Get the Idea

* Use images to raise awareness about an issue or campaign
* Often emotive, using shock, humour, subversion, metaphor
* Intended to challenge the viewer

* Illustrate a complex point
* Provide novel perspectives
