## Overview

* **Engage**: get attention through a memorable image
* **Communicate an argument**: summarise concepts through a design
* **Draw the viewer in**: give them a way to explore the issue further

## Getting People to Care

* Need to develop communities that care about something
* Understand existing, shared values and beliefs
* Instill new values and beliefs
* Effective visual campaign:
	* current facts and problem
	* implied promise for the future
	* implied justification for change



## 1. Get the Idea

* Use images to raise awareness about an issue or campaign
* Often emotive, using shock, humour, subversion, metaphor
* Intended to challenge the viewer

## Walk this Way

* Portrays two kinds of water consumption:
	* Direct (e.g. washing up)
	* Indirect (e.g., beef production)
* Mapped over a typical day (cf. user journey)
* For each water consumption type, an alternative is presented
