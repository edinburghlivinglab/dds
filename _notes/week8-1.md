2. The things that I really want to do this week are ...

# Visualisation and Advocacy

## Overview

* **Engage**: get attention through a memorable image
* **Communicate an argument**: summarise concepts through a design
* **Draw the viewer in**: give them a way to explore the issue further

## Getting People to Care

* Need to develop communities that care about something
* Understand existing, shared values and beliefs
* Instill new values and beliefs
* Effective visual campaign:
	* current facts and problem
	* implied promise for the future
	* implied justification for change
