# Food and Sustainability

## Recap, issues, writing (10.00-10.15)

##  Just Writing

Get yourself an empty writing book just for this course
It's up to you whether it's lined or unlined.
This book will be **private**.

Outcome doesn't matter
Preparation for 'real' writing


## It's in the doing.

1. You need a **prompt** -- we'll give you a couple initially. It frames what you are going to write.
1. Write the prompt you've chosen as the first thing on the page.
2. Keep your hand moving on the page until time is up. Your writign doesn't need to be fast. Don't stop until time is up! (Creates a direct link between your mind and your hand. Exploring relationship between thinking and doing.) 
2. Try to stay focussed on the prompt, but if you feel you are getting stuck, try the other prompt.
3. You don't need to write well. You don't need to like what you've written.
4. You're not allowed to show this writing to anyone else.

## Today's Prompts

1. What thoughts and feelings do I associate with food?
2. What is sustainability?

## Reflection / Discussion

* What's the point of writing if you don't write well? (Content, idea generaion, writing 'muscle')
* What happens if you let your hand stop? (You look back, you start **editing**.)
* How is it different from the way you usually write?
* What happens when you find it hard to keep going?
* What happens when time is up?
* What happens if you review past sessions? What themes, ideas, patterns start to emerge? But keep some distance, don't do it too soon.

* When you set your own prompts, try to decide what is the 'next frontier' for your own research.
* Begin before you begin. (Not a first draft.)


What I don't understand
Where is this taking me
What is the next question?
Where do I find that out?
