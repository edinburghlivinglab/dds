					Assessment for the course will

					exams.</p>
				<p class="lead">
					You will be assessed on two
					pieces of work. The main one
					will be a personal report
					which will describe the
					project that you have carried
					out, what your personal
					contribution was to the
					project, your goals and your
					conclusions. The second piece
					of work will be a group
					presentation of your team's
					project.</p>
