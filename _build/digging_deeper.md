Fast Hack individual reporting (formative assignment 1): due 16:00 Monday, February 8th, 2016<br/>
Peer feedback on Fast Hack individual reports: due February.....<br/>
Innovative Learning Week (no class): February 15&ndash;19th<br/>

## Description

This phase is the transition between the initial information-gathering and problem exploration in the  [Fast Hack]({{ site.baseurl }}/fast_hack/), and developing a single, more nuanced problem solution during the [Slow Hack (Phase 3)]({{ site.baseurl }}/slow_hack/). Your group will continue to discuss, process and build on the information gained in the Fast Hack, through a combination of individual, group, and class activities.

To gain the skills and information needed to conduct a larger and more sophisticated version of the Fast Hack, we will “dig deeper” into the topics we introduced in Phases 0 and 1. These topics include data types, management, and data vs information, and also ethics, privacy, and methods for working with stakeholders (and analysing the results). This will involve a combination of class exercises and lectures, videos, readings, and interactive iPython online notebooks. 

All groups need to further explore the possible problems/solutions they identified in the Fast Hack, and collect more information about their sub-theme. At the end of Fast Hack, groups will not be ready to go directly into the Slow Hack. That is why we have a specific transition phase.

### Stakeholder focus groups

As part of the exploration and information-gathering process, each group will hold a small focus group with university stakeholders during Phase 2. This is essentially a discussion around specific questions, moderated by a researcher (in this case, a member of your group). Through stakeholders’ discussion with each other and the group members, there will be an opportunity to gain more information about the problem area, generate new ideas, and get preliminary feedback about ideas from the Fast Hack. Even if your group likes an idea, stakeholders may not understand the idea, or think it meets their needs! 

The course staff will help you to organise the stakeholder focus group, and recruit participants. There will be a supported, in-class data analysis session to help you make sense of the information you collect. Your group will need to organise your own, additional design session with stakeholders during the Slow Hack. You will be expected to be much more independent during the Slow Hack, so it is essential to fully participate in the phase 2 focus group and analysis sessions in order to learn these skills.


## By the End of this Phase

You should have completed all class and homework activities to equip yourself with the skills needed for the Slow Hack, including the basic skills needed to work with stakeholders.

Your group should have completed a stakeholder focus group and analysed the resulting data.

Your group should have narrowed down their ideas and identified a specific question or problem area within your sub-topic. The group can give a clear explanation of what the problem is, and explain how this choice was justified by information you have collected, including information from the stakeholder focus group.

Your group should have stored any newly collected data in accordance with approved DDS and university data management and privacy requirements. 


## Learning Outcomes for this Phase

* Identify and apply relevant strategies for data collection and related prototype 'interventions' which address the interests and needs of a specified community of stakeholders.
* Demonstrate an ability to work in an interdisciplinary team and to act in a professional manner when interacting with stakeholders and the public
