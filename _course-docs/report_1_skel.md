# Introduction

Briefly describe the challenge that your team is addressing, together with the specific problem area within that challenge. 

Briefly outline the main components and ideas in the rest of the report so the reader knows what to expect.


# Evidence

## Stakeholders

Which individuals, groups and organisations are most relevant to the problem area and may be important for addressing it?

## Engagement

What steps have you taken so far to engage with stakeholders? 

## Data


* What data did you collect for the Fast Hack? What methods did you use to collect it, and how are you dealing with data management?
* What other datasets, if any, did you use? How did you access them, and what are their properties (e.g., format, geographical and temporal coverage, relevance).


# Initial Interpretation

What information (ideas, hypotheses, inferences, questions) have you derived from the data so far? 

Consider what is the most relevant way of presenting this information. Try to use some simple visualisations, even if it is just a simple bar-chart.


# Evaluation 

How useful is the information that you've gathered so far? Be honest and critical about the data that you've used. Is it robust? How complete is it? 

# Next Steps

What do you think needs to be done next in order to get a deeper understanding of your problem area? What additional evidence would you like to collect? What hypotheses do you want to explore?


# Reflections

What has been your personal experience of working on this project to date? For instance, how have you dealt with challenges of engaging with people in the University community. What has been your experience of working within a team and sharing out work, responsibilities and roles? What aspects of the course have worked well for you, and what would you like to see changed?



# Conclusions

Summarise the main things that you've tried to do, and what you have accomplished. This part of your report will try to draw together the main threads of your report. Some readers may jump straight to the conclusion to see whether it is worth reading the main body of the report, so try to emphasise the key 'take home' points.
