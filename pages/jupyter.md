## Logging on to JupyterHub

The University is running a multiuser [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) Notebook server as a trial. The framework for this service is called JupyterHub.

To log in to the JupyterHub server, point your browser at <https://jupyter-inf.is.ed.ac.uk>. You will initially be required to authenticate via EASE using your University user name and password. Under the current configuration, you will (probably) get to a page that looks like this:

![Jupyter login page]({{ site.urlimg }}jupyter00.tiff)

Select **dds-notebooks**, and on the following page select **notebooks**.
