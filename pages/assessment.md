	Assessment for the course will be 100% coursework. There are
	no exams.</p>
	<p>
	You will be assessed on two pieces of work. The main one will
	be a personal report which will describe the team project that
	you have carried out, what your personal contribution was to
	the project, your goals and your conclusions. The second piece
	of work will be a group presentation of your team's
	project.</p>
	<p>
	There will also be two pieces of coursework earlier in the
	semester, again consisting of a personalreport and a group
	presentation. However, these will not contribute to the
	overall grade for the course. Instead, they will be
	anopportunity for you to receive feedback and 'feedforward' in
	preparation for the assessed coursework.</p>
