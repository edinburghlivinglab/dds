## Food and Sustainability in the University

The University of Edinburgh is currently in [the process of drafting its first
sustainable food policy](http://www.ed.ac.uk/about/sustainability/news/draft-
food-consultation). The overall aim of this policy is to facilitate the creation
of sustainable food systems. This can be defined as *systems where the ways in
which food is produced, purchased, consumed and disposed of are both sustainable
and socially responsible*.

There is huge scope for designing, building and measuring experimental
innovations to improve food sustainability in the University. This course will
give you an opportunity to do just this. Projects will be scoped out in the
first few weeks of the course, and then developed in detail from Week
5.

In order to narrow down the scope of projects, we propose the
following four challenges:

1. Reducing wastage of food served in Pollock Halls Dining Hall
2. Reducing packaging waste at any point in the production and
consumption of food on campus.
3. Increasing rate at which students select healthy /
sustainable food options, either
    * on campus, or
    * off campus
