## Food and Sustainability in the University

The **theme** of the course this year is Food and Sustainability &mdash; how can we make the production, consumption and disposal of food within the University    more sustainable?

The University of Edinburgh is currently in the process of drafting its first
[sustainable food policy](http://www.ed.ac.uk/about/sustainability/news/draft-
food-consultation).  There is huge scope for designing, building and measuring experimental
innovations that engage with this policy goal. We want you do this in your project.

In order to narrow down the scope of what you do, we suggest that you focus your project on one of the
following **sub-themes**:

<div>
	<div class="medium-panel">
		<p>Reducing wastage of food served in Pollock Halls Dining Hall</p>
	</div>
	<div class="medium-panel">
		<p>Reducing packaging waste at any point in the production and
			consumption of food on campus.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="medium-panel">
			<p>Increasing the rate at which students select healthy /
				sustainable food options, either on campus, or off campus; and with either prepared food or raw ingredients.
			</ul>
			</p>
		</div>
