## Food and Sustainability in the University

The **theme** of the course this year is Food and Sustainability &mdash; how can we make the production, consumption and disposal of food within the University  more sustainable?

The University of Edinburgh is currently in the process of drafting its first
[sustainable food policy]({{ site.baseurl }}/course_docs/sustainable_food_policy_sept_2014.pdf).  In this course, your main objective is to work in a small team to develop a project that engages with this policy goal, by designing, building and measuring experimental
innovations 


In order to narrow down the scope of what you do, we ask you focus your project on one of the
following **sub-themes**:

<div>
    <div class="medium-panel">
        <p>Reducing wastage of food served in Pollock Halls Dining Hall</p>
    </div>
    <div class="medium-panel">
        <p>Reducing packaging waste at any point in the production and consumption of food on campus.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="medium-panel">
        <p>Increasing the rate at which students select healthy / sustainable food options, either on campus, or off campus; and with either prepared food or raw ingredients.
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>
</div>

Your project work will be divided into five phases over the course of the semester. Descriptions of the phases can be found by following the links below:

2. [Fast Hack]({{ site.baseurl }}/fast_hack)
3. [Digging Deeper]({{ site.baseurl }}/digging_deeper)
4. [Slow Hack]({{ site.baseurl }}/slow_hack)
5. [Reporting]({{ site.baseurl }}/reporting)

## Design and Design Methods

The core of a DDS project is closely related to how we think about "design".
Here, design is about the processes of identifying and solving problems, often
with input from other people affected by those problems, and often by trial
and error. We are interested in **design methods** as a form of exploring the
world, considering options&mdash;even options that sound strange,
uncomfortable or impossible&mdash;and then developing "interventions" that may
help us change the current state of the world into a preferred one.

Design, as a discipline and a collection of processes, has no requirement to
use technology. There is also no requirement to build physical  or digital
"stuff". Design may be mostly about ideas, and imagining how something could
potentially work very differently than it does now. Many designs may involve
technology, or make physical objects, but only where this seems appropriate
for the problem at hand.

Similarly, success in DDS is not about making a certain type of "thing", using
a certain amount of  technology, or getting certain results. It is almost
entirely about your team participating in and reflecting on different parts of
a design process, as you develop a potential solution to a problem.  Food and
sustainability is a large and complex issue that doesn't admit easy solutions,
let alone in one semester. Although much of our education encourages us to
find the right answer, making the transition to a more sustainable food system
isn't that kind of problem&mdash;there is no right answer. Instead, we are
asking you do develop a design that could *potentially* make a difference on
your chosen problem.

Suppose you experiment with an intervention, and it doesn't do what you
expected. One way of thinking about this is that your design "failed". Another
way of thinking about it is that you have learned something, namely that
some of your predictions and assumptions turn out to be incorrect. It is not
so important whether your project succeeds or fails to do what you intended.
What does matter is that you can show what you have learned from the outcomes
and that you can show that you have thought carefully about the methods that
you adopted.
