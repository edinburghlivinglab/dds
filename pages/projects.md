## Food and Sustainability in the University

The **theme** of the course this year is Food and Sustainability &mdash; how can we make the production, consumption and disposal of food within the University  more sustainable?

The University of Edinburgh is currently in the process of drafting its first
[sustainable food policy]({{ site.baseurl }}/course_docs/sustainable_food_policy_sept_2014.pdf).  In this course, your main objective is to work in a small team to develop a project that engages with this policy goal, by designing, building and measuring experimental
innovations 


In order to narrow down the scope of what you do, we ask you focus your project on one of the
following **sub-themes**:

<div>
    <div class="medium-panel">
        <p>Reducing wastage of food served in Pollock Halls Dining Hall</p>
    </div>
    <div class="medium-panel">
        <p>Reducing packaging waste at any point in the production and consumption of food on campus.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="medium-panel">
        <p>Increasing the rate at which students select healthy / sustainable food options, either on campus, or off campus; and with either prepared food or raw ingredients.
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>
</div>
