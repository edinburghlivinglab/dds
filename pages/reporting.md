## Key Dates

Design critique, peer feedback group mini-presentations: Class time, Wednesday March 16th
Group Slow Hack presentations (worth 25%): class time, Wednesday March 23rd
Feedback (unclear on syllabus what this is): class time, Friday March 25th
Summative individual reporting (assignment 2, worth 75%): due Friday, April 1st (not a joke)

DESCRIPTION:
The big goal of this phase is to bring all of your group’s information together and use it to tell a clear, convincing, easy-to-understand story about a particular problem related to Food and Sustainability, and how your proof-of-concept idea has the potential to solve this problem. You will have stopped collecting new data.  In this phase, you are analysing and making sense of the information you already have (through qualitative description, statistics, visualisations, connection to policy documents and other data sets...). 

In class, there will be tutorial help available (similar to phase 3), to help your group work with data (summarisation, visualisation, statistics) and use it a part of your overall argument. These skills on understanding and presenting data, and using it as a way to “tell stories” about a phenomenon, are some of the most versatile transferable skills we will cover in this course. 

The “reporting” part of this phase includes a group presentation (worth 25%) and an individual report (worth 75%). The presentation and report are similar to the format and requirements of the Fast Hack presentation/report completed earlier in the semester, and for which you will have already received formative feedback. 

Design critique, peer feedback group mini-presentations
To help groups work on their data interpretation and their explanations of their project, we will have  an in-class design critique and feedback session. Each group will briefly present some of their Slow Hack findings and data to the rest of the class, and have a chance to discuss these. This presentation is NOT GRADED and is not expected to be “finished” in any way. It is about discussing, more than presenting. Having fresh input can also be very valuable, as members of other groups may suggest new, previously unseen connections and implications. An overall idea—or the explanation of an idea--can be substantially strengthened after outside input. Professional researchers and designers definitely engage in this type of critique and peer feedback and find it very valuable, which is why we are doing it here. 

YOUR PRESENTATION:
We're asking your presentation to address three broad questions, using the information you have collected over the course of the semester (all phases).
• Briefly, what is the current state of your food and sustainability sub-theme at the University? Where are we starting from--what is happening (or not happening) right now? Focus on the sub-theme as it relates to the specific question your group addressed. 
• What is the specific question or problem that your group has investigated? Why focus on this question?
• How does your group propose to address this problem? Describe the design of your proof-of-concept solution. What is the idea, how would it work? Convince us that your idea has the potential to solve the problem. 
• Connections to university policy?

In the presentation, your group needs to explain what data you collected (and/or looked up in existing datasets) and what kind of data it is. If asked, be ready to give details on how, where, and when it was collected. The answer to each broad question needs to clearly and explicitly state how the group’s actions and decisions were informed by data.

You are encouraged to make your presentations very visual-- use photos, drawings, videos, animations, graphs, visualisations, maps (etc) to help communicate about the data you collected, and your design ideas. You are also welcome to use physical objects, apps/websites, or to “role play” how your idea would work. It is up to your group how best to communicate your problem, your data, and the proof-of-concept solution.


BY THE END OF THIS PHASE: 
You should have completed your summative individual reporting, including commenting specifically on your contribution to the final proof-of-concept design and the group presentation.

Your group should be able to communicate the overall idea of your project (problem + solution) in a tweet (i.e. 140 characters).

Your group should have created a presentation of your problem and your design solution, which tells a clear and compelling story based on the data collected in all phases. 

Your group should have archived, destroyed, or handed over your data and metadata, as per DDS policies and your individual group’s planning. 

Your group should have.... other documentation, photos, text for web? Basically any other end-of-project reporting outwith presentation.


LEARNING OUTCOMES FOR THIS PHASE:
• Synthesize and communicate the information from two or more datasets using appropriate analytic, presentation and visualisation techniques.
• Interpret and evaluate data in a way that demonstrates its relevance to selected communication and/or policy objectives.
