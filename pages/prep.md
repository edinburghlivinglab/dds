<!-- # Introduction and Preparation  -->

## Key Dates

Course start: Wednesday, January 13th<br/>
Team formation: Wednesday, January 20th


## Description

In this phase, you will be introduced to the main ideas and goals of the DDS
course. It will explain our intended ways of working, and why we might want to
do something that looks so different to a typical university course. Overall,
we are using a "hack methodology" in conjunction with tools and techniques
from design, the social sciences, and informatics.

### What is a hack? 

A hack (or hackathon) originally referred to a group of programmers,
designers, and other technology experts engaging in a short period of
intensive development (e.g., "build an app/game in a weekend!"). Now the term
is often used more broadly, to refer to any period of focused, intensive
collaboration between experts and stakeholders. Hacks may be about solving a
particular problem (e.g. making dementia-friendly bathrooms), or more
generally exploring a topic (e.g., what can you make with available open data
sets?). For example, the recent [Walk Hack](http://www.sustrans.org.uk/news/edinburgh-launches-walk-hack) (October 2015) brought together
researchers, designers, technologists, Edinburgh Council representatives,
local organisations and interested residents in order to work together on
ideas for promoting walking in the Edinburgh city centre. How could it be made
safer, more interesting, more appealing, "better"?

As part of the DDS hack method, you will work in small interdisciplinary
teams, and are required to involve community stakeholders in your project at
several points during the course. All teams will be presenting to one another
and giving each other feedback throughout the course. Part of the point of a
hack is to exchange expertise, viewpoints and ideas, to make mistakes, and to
try new things.

There will be two separate hacks as a part of DDS: a Fast Hack (Phase 1)
intended to explore our theme (below), identify specific problems and generate
ideas, and a Slow Hack (Phase 3) intended to develop a single design in more
depth, over a longer period of time.

### Theme: Food and Sustainability

In 2016, DDS will have a "Food and Sustainability" theme, focused on the
University of Edinburgh community. In Phase 0, several speakers will present
on food and sustainability issues, and we will also look at university and
EUSA policy on this issue. All DDS teams will focus on developing a design-led
proposal to solve a problem within **one** food and sustainability sub-theme:

* Waste in Pollock Halls dining hall
* Packaging waste
* Increasing student selection of healthy/sustainable food options 
  (might be on or off-campus, ingredients or pre-prepared food)



### Orientation to skills and content

We do not expect that students will start DDS with all the skills they will
need to be successful. Between lecture content, activities, and homework, we
will introduce four key topics in preparation for the Fast Hack phase:

* food andsustainability issues;
* intro to design thinking; 
* intro to data and information; 
* intro to observation, ethnography, and ethics. 

We will revisit
these topics in Phase 2 (Digging Deeper). It is very important to attend class
and keep up with homework in the first weeks, as these cover information
essential to participating in the next phases of the course. Students will
find it very difficult to catch up on this information later.

Starting in Phase 0 and continuing throughout the course, we will also work on
writing, presenting, and teamwork skills. Individuals and groups will be
pushed to explain and justify their work. We see these as central to course
success, and as major transferable skills that students can take away from
DDS.

## By the End of this Phase

You should have a clear idea of what the DDS course will be about and what you
will do for the rest of term. You should have participated in class and
homework activities to orient yourself to the four key topics. You should have
signed the DDS ethics agreement.

Your group should have formed, chosen **one** of the four sub-themes, and
discussed different group members' interests within that sub-theme as a
preparation for the Fast Hack.
