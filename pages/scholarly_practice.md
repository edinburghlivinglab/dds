Good Scholarly Practice: Please remember the University requirement as regards all assessed work for credit. Details about this can be found at:

Furthermore, you are required to take reasonable measures to protect your assessed work from unauthorised access. For example, if you put any such work on a public repository then you must set access permissions appropriately (generally permitting access only to yourself, or your group in the case of group practicals).
