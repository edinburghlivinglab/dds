Below, we spell out what your team should achieve in order for your project to count as successful for DDS.

#### Explore a subtopic of food and sustainability issues at the University and propose a design-based solution to a current question or problem

* Over the course of the project, identify a clear question or problem within one DDS 
subtopic and propose an intervention to solve the problem or answer the question. 

* Using information from the world (e.g. stakeholder involvement, existing data, observation), be able to explain the current situation at the University with relation to the subtopic and 
problem, and from that information identify a potential problem or question on which to focus your 
project.
* After considering multiple options, develop a design idea (intervention) with the 
potential to solve the problem. 

<!-- Relates to the following learning objectives [from DRPS text as of Nov 23]
¥	Identify and apply relevant strategies for data collection and related prototype 
'interventions' which address the interests and needs of a specified community of 
stakeholders. -->

#### Effectively communicate about design and data

* Be able to expla your problem and design intervention in a way that a general (non-DDS) audience 
would be able to understand, and convince the audience that the design may be able to answer the 
team's particular question or solve the problem.

* Be able show that you have used two types of required data in the project, and have analysed and 
presented them in an appropriate and relevant way that supports your design idea.

* Show an attempt to connect the group's problem choice and final design back to wider food and 
sustainability issues and policies (e.g. University and EUSA policy).

<!-- Relates to the following learning objectives [from DRPS text as of Nov 23]
¥	Synthesize and communicate the information from two or more datasets using appropriate 
analytic, presentation and visualisation techniques.
¥	Interpret and evaluate data in a way that demonstrates its relevance to selected 
communication and/or policy objectives. -->


#### Engage in ongoing reflection and justification

* At all stages,  document and reflect on the information collected and try to learn from 
it, feeding at least some of it back into their project. 

* At all stages, your team is able to explain the  decision-making process and justify (i.e. provide 
reasons and evidence for) those decisions, especially where there were multiple "good" options for 
what you could do.

#### Demonstrate consistent participation and professional working

* Participate in all the phases of the course, and all whole-class or centrally planned activities 
including lectures, workshops, participant engagement, writing activities etc.

* Complete participant engagement and any other tasks that individual teams have been 
assigned to organise.

* Show contribution and teamwork from all your team members.

* Actively consider  ethical issues, and complied with course, University, and UK legal rules for 
data collection and handling. 

<!-- Relates to the following learning objectives [from DRPS text as of Nov 23]
¥	Demonstrate an ability to work in an interdisciplinary team and to act in a professional 
manner when interacting with stakeholders and the public.  -->

## Anti-Success

Having a successful project does **not** depend on:

* Pleasing DDS staff members and only choosing options or methods you think
they like! The  important thing is that your team can give a good explanation
of what you have done, and why,  and how. It is **your** project, and you have
the final ownership and responsibility for it.

* Having "good" or "significant" results, or testing your final design with
lots of people. DDS  projects are intended to be small. You will have limited
time to test your final design. This is OK. Much more important is being able
to discuss and use the information  that you do have, and to reflect on your
design.

* Having the right answer. There is no one "right answer" to your team's
question, there may be hundreds! This is not the same as saying that all
answers are equally good. An "answer" (or rather,  a design) reached through
observation, inclusion of participants, and iteration is a better answer than
one that a team "made up" just because they liked it. Engaging with the
design process is very  important for the final quality of your project, and
developing a design (course of action) that could  get you from the existing
state to your preferred state.

* Being perfect. Every team will make mistakes, forget things, or wish they had made different 
decisions. Professional researchers and designers do all of these things too. This does not make 
your project bad, but does mean that you should be learning from these things, and be ready to
