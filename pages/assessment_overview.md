	<p>
	Assessment for the course will be 100% coursework. There are
	no exams.</p>
	<p>

	You will be assessed on two pieces of work. The main one will
	be a personal report which will describe the team project that
	you have carried out, what your personal contribution was to
	the project, your goals and your conclusions. The second piece
	of work will be a group presentation of your team's
	project.</p>

	<p>
	There will also be two pieces of coursework earlier in the
	semester, again consisting of a personal report and a group
	presentation. However, these will not contribute to the
	overall grade for the course. Instead, they will be
	an opportunity for you to receive feedback and 'feedforward' in
	preparation for the assessed coursework.</p>

	<div class="text-center">
	<table class="table" summary="Table of coursework information, specifying the week it is due, the precise deadline, whether it is a presentation or report, and the weight it contributes to the overall grade. ">

	<h3>Scholarly Good Practice</h3>

	<p>
	Please remember the University requirements as regards all assessed work for credit. Details about this can be found at the following links:</p>

	<ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/academic-services/students/undergraduate/discipline/academic-misconduct">University Information on Academic Misconduct</a></li>

      <li><a href="http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/infweb/admin/policies/academic-misconduct">School of Informatics Information on Academic Misconduct</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>Furthermore, you are required to take reasonable measures to protect your assessed work from unauthorised access. For example, if you put any such work on a public repository then you must set access permissions appropriately (generally permitting access only to yourself, or your group in the case of group practicals). </p>
