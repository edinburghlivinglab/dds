## Description

In this phase, you and your group will conduct a preliminary investigation on a sub-theme related to food and sustainability. This is the first step to identifying a specific problem or question that your group will work on for the rest of term, designing a possible solution. You will need to put into practice the skills and knowledge introduced in [Phase 0]({{ site.baseurl }}/preparation/). Participating fully in the Fast Hack and being engaged with your group is the best possible preparation for the rest of the course. 

The Fast Hack has two main tasks for each group:
1. Gather information about your chosen sub-theme and its state at the University of Edinburgh, right now
2. Identify specific problems/questions within your sub-theme, and generate ideas for how to address those  problems/questions

### Task 1: Information-gathering

In order to propose a design-led solution to a problem, you must first identify a specific problem, and understand the context in which you are working. What is happening (or not happening) right now with respect to your sub-theme? What do people want, think, do, or say in relation to the sub-theme? 

During the Fast Hack, you are a detective. Just as a detective must go to places and speak to people in order to understand “what happened” and why, you must leave the classroom and spend time in the university community to understand what's happening (and why) on your chosen sub-theme. While DDS students already have experiences around food and sustainability at the university, it is very important not to **only** rely on your group's pre-existing ideas. Try to look at familiar things with “fresh eyes”, as though you were visiting an unknown place or culture. Question things that seem given, or obvious.

The [DDS sub-themes]({{ site.baseurl }}/project_overview) are still very big. Your group will need to think about your interest and priorities within the sub-theme. Your group will need to plan:

* Where to go during Fast Hack
* Who to talk to &mdash; may be groups, individuals, organisations
* What you want to find out (types of information to collect)
* Practicalities: any equipment needed, staying in touch on the day, storing information... 

At the same time as planning how to use your time, you should be ready to follow up on interesting, unexpected things you might stumble across during your investigation.

Some starting information for the Fast Hack is available here:

* Food and sustainability: e.g. university policy...
* Data sets:
* Other???


### Task 2: Identify problems and generate ideas

Once you have some done some information-gathering from relevant locations and people, you can start to identify specific problem areas. What are smaller challenges, within the sub-topic, to which you might be able to design a proof-of-concept solution? At this stage, your group does not have to (and SHOULD NOT) choose only one problem and solution. You should show that you have identified several possible problems and solutions, based on the Fast Hack.

At this stage, you do not need to have worked out all the details of an idea, and do not need to worry about financial viability or building anything. Focus on generating and communicating ideas that could potentially help solve your identified problem. What would you do, and why? What impact might this idea have on food and sustainability?


## Your Presentation

We're asking your presentation to address three questions, using as many forms of information as you can reasonably collect during the Fast Hack:

* What is the current state of your food and sustainability sub-theme at the University? Where are we starting from &mdash; what is happening (or not happening) right now?
* What are some of the specific food and sustainability problems you might be able to address, within this sub-theme?
* What are some possible ideas for addressing each problem (i.e. improving some aspect of food-related sustainability)?

In the presentation, your group needs to be able to explain what information you collected (and/or looked up), what kind of information it is, and how the answers to your three questions (current state, possible problems, possible ideas) are based on your Fast Hack information. Be ready to explain how, where, and when you collected this information. 

You are encouraged to make your presentations visual-- use photos, drawings, videos, animations, graphs, maps (etc) to help communicate about the information you collected, and your design ideas. 


## By the End of this Phase: 

You should have started your summative individual reporting (due early in next phase) including commenting specifically on your contribution to the Fast Hack ideas and presentation.

Your group should have created a presentation of the information gathered in Fast Hack, and your initial ideas, and be able to clearly explain what you have done so far and why.

Your group should have stored any collected data in accordance with approved DDS and university data management and privacy requirements. 


## Learning Outcomes for this Phase:

* Synthesize and communicate the information from two or more datasets using appropriate analytic, presentation and visualisation techniques.
* Interpret and evaluate data in a way that demonstrates its relevance to selected communication and/or policy objectives.
* Demonstrate an ability to work in an interdisciplinary team and to act in a professional manner when interacting with stakeholders and the public.
