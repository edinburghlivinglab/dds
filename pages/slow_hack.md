## Key Dates

Last day for data collection: Friday March 11th</br>
PD activity with stakeholders: your group must schedule between February 24th and March 11th 


## Description

In this phase, your group will start with the design idea identified during the Digging Deeper phase, and flesh out this idea into a proof-of-concept solution to your problem. Your idea will likely evolve over the Slow Hack as you discuss it further, consult stakeholders, and collect new data—it might look very different in the end than at the start. This is good! 

In class, we will continue working on skills around interpreting data and using it to tell stories and build convincing arguments. There will also be in-class tutorial help available for your group, to help you plan your activity in this phase and work with the data you are collecting. 

### How is this different than the Fast Hack?

In one sentence, Fast Hack was broad but shallow, while the Slow Hack is narrower, deeper, and more concerned with details.  The Fast Hack was trying to find out as much as possible, as quickly as possible because the group did not yet know what might be particularly interesting or useful within their sub-theme. A main goal was to identify several problems or questions, for which the group might propose several initial ideas. By the start of the Slow Hack, groups have narrowed down to ONE problem area or question, by continuing to build on and refine work started in the Fast Hack. The group now has an idea about a possible solution, and Slow Hack will develop this initial idea into a proof-of-concept design. 

### Determining what to do is a main part of “the work” in Slow Hack!

In phases 0-2, the different DDS groups will likely have been doing similar things and will have had specific instructions from the lecturer. In this phase your group has more choice and more responsibility to determine what you need to do.  It is up to each group to use their experience and the course resources from phases 0-2 in order to develop their starting idea into a more detailed, proof-of-concept design. Unlike earlier phases, there will not be specific instructions on exactly what information to look for, or what to do.  Developing and justifying your group’s course of action—out of the many possibilities—is a main part of the work in this stage. For example, it might be very important for one group to be building and critiquing prototypes of a physical object, but that might make no sense for another group’s idea, which features a website.

### Participatory design with stakeholders

All groups are required to have at least one more participatory design session with stakeholders (most groups may only have time for 1, but are welcome to do more). Unlike in phase 2, there will now be several options for what type of session to do. Your group will need to choose which option makes most sense for your project, and will get you the feedback and information you need. Do not underestimate the amount of planning required for this to be successful. Your group is encouraged to discuss their goals and options, and start organising a session as soon as they can. 


## By the End of this Phase

You should understand and be able to explain what your group has done in the Slow Hack and why those actions were chosen, out of the available possibilities.

Your group should have conducted an additional participatory design session with university stakeholders, abiding by the DDS and university ethics requirements. Data analysis may still be in progress. 

Your group should have engaged in whatever other activities are necessary to develop your initial idea into a proof-of-concept scale idea. This will definitely include discussion, reflection, and critique within the group. This may include creating sketches, maps, physical prototypes, a website, or some other representation of your idea; may include additional data collection or seeking out existing data; may include additional participatory design; other. 

Your group does **not** need to have “solved” your problem. In the next phase, you will need to show that your idea has the potential to solve or at least affect the problem.

You and your group should have stored any newly collected data in accordance with approved DDS and university data management and privacy requirements. 

## Learning Outcomes for this Phase

* Identify and apply relevant strategies for data collection and related prototype 'interventions' which address the interests and needs of a specified community of stakeholders.
* Demonstrate an ability to work in an interdisciplinary team and to act in a professional manner when interacting with stakeholders and the public.
