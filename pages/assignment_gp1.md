For this assignment, your team ahould make a group presentation that addresses three questions, using as many forms of
information as you can reasonably collect during the [Fast Hack]({{ site.baseurl }}/fast_hack/):

1. What is the current state of your food and sustainability sub-theme at the
University? Where are we starting from &mdash; what is happening (or not
happening) right now?

2. What are some of the specific food and sustainability problems you might be
able to address, within this sub-theme?

3. What are some possible ideas for addressing each problem (i.e. improving
some aspect of food-related sustainability)?

In the presentation, your team needs to be able to explain what information
you collected (and/or looked up), what kind of information it is, and how the
answers to your three questions (current state, possible problems, possible
ideas) are based on your Fast Hack information. Be ready to explain how,
where, and when you collected this information.

You are encouraged to make your presentations visual&mdash;use photos,
drawings, videos, animations, graphs, maps, etc. to help communicate about the
information you collected, and your design ideas.
