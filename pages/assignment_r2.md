**General instructions** 

* Assume you are writing your report for someone who did *not* see your Slow Hack presentation.
* Aim to produce a report of about 6 pages long, plus diagrams and references. If you want to write a bit more, that's OK but don't write more than 8 pages. 
* The report should cover **all phases** of your project (i.e., from the Fast Hack through to the end of the Slow Hack).
* Your report will naturally include material that relates to the project that was carried out by your team, not just to your own personal contribution. However, it is important that all the text included in your report is your own. Your report should also be your personal perspective on the work carried out.
* The remainder of this document is a skeleton that serves two functions:
   * It lists and explains the content that you should aim to include in your report.
   * Since it is written in [Markdown syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), you can use it directly as the starting point for writing your report.

# 1. Introduction

Give an overview of the questions / challenges that you addressed during your project. Why are they interesting and relevant? Try to set them within the general context of the University's Food and Sustainability Policy. 


# 2. Discover

## Stakeholders

Which individuals, groups and organisations were most relevant to the problem area and were important for addressing it?

## Engagement

How did you engage with stakeholders during your project? What did you learn from your work with the stakeholder focus group?

## Data

Remember that you should have used at least 
[two kinds of data]({{ site.baseurl }}/project_overview/#two_kinds_of_data) in your project.

* What data did you collect for your project? What methods did you use to collect it, and how are you dealing with data management?
* What other datasets did you use? How did you access them, and what are their properties (e.g., format, geographical and temporal coverage, relevance)?



# 3. Define

Tell us at least three things about your problem area that you found out during your project. For each of the things you learned, relate it back to the information reported in the 'Discover' section. 

Be explicit about the various options for designing a solution or intervention, and explain what steps you took to narrow down the possibilities. What factors were important to you in making choices?



# 4. Develop

In the course of your project, you should have taken steps to test
and experiment with interventions and/or prototype solutions, including one or more participatory design workshops. Explain how you used a process of trial and error to refine your ideas.



How useful is the information that you've gathered for understanding your specific problem area? Be honest and critical about the data that you've used. How complete is it? Do you think there are shortcomings in it? 

# 5. Next Steps

Within the scope of this course, it would not be possible to deliver a working solution. However, you should be able to indicate some steps and further research that that would help move things to a further stage. For example:

 * Is there additional data required?
 * Do you need to carry out further testing and experimentation?

 If you think that your ideas don't have the potential for further development, say why and how you might have done things differently with the wisdom of hindsight.


# 6. Reflections

## What has been your personal experience of working on this project? 

If you're stuck in writing this section, some of the issues you might think about are:

* How have you dealt with challenges of engaging with people in the University community. 
* What has been your experience of working within a team and sharing out work, responsibilities and roles? 
* What aspects of the course have worked well for you, and what would you like to see changed?

# 7. Your contribution

Say what your personal contribution was to the team effort during the project. This should cover all phases of the project.

# 8. Conclusions

Summarise overall what you personally, and your team, have accomplished in
your project.  This part of your report should draw together the main threads
of your report. Try to emphasise four key 'take home' points for the reader.
