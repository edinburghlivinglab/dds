# 1. Introduction
[5%] 
Briefly explain the problem you are addressing, and why you think it is important. Place it in a broader context, for example in relation to the University's Sustainable Food Policy and other information on food and sustainability that you regards as relevant.

# 2. Describing Your Problem Area 
[20% - Mainly LO1]
Explain in more detail what your problem is, what stakeholders are relevant, and what stakeholder needs have to be taken into account. It's possible that different stakeholder groups have different interests and priorities -- try to explain what these are. 

# 3. Your Design Idea
[45% -  LO1, LO2, LO3]
Describe the primary design idea that you developed. Justify **why** you developed this particular idea from among the range of options that you considered, and relate it to the problem area described in the previous section. What evidence do you have for the feasibility of this idea? Use appropriate techniques (e.g., tables, graphs, diagrams, photos) for communicating the information that supports your idea. NB You can draw on any research or design exercises carried out within your team, not just information that you collected by yourself.

# 4. Evaluation and Next Steps
[10% - LO2]
What do you think needs to be done next in order to further develop your idea and perhaps bring about actual change? What additional evidence would you like to collect or what further user testing? It's possible that you think that the primary idea that you pursued should **not** be pursued further -- if so, explain your conclusions.

# 5. Reflections
[15% - LO4]
What has been your personal experience of working on this project? What was your personal contribution to the team effort during the Slow Hack?

# 6. Conclusions
[5%]
Summarise overall what you personally, and your team, have accomplished in
your project.  This part of your report should draw together the main threads
of your report. Try to emphasise four key 'take home' points for the reader.
