**General instructions** 

* Assume you are writing your report for someone who has *not* been involved in the DDS course in any way and has little or no knowledge of / interest in sustainability. 
* Your report should be at least 2,500 words long but no more than 3,000 words. You may in addition provide an appendix if you wish (e.g., to list a questionnaire or to give details of data that was collected), but you are not required to do so. An appendix will not count towards the word limit.
* 
* The remainder of this document is a skeleton that lists and explains the content that you should aim to include in your report. Please do use these section headers in your report; you may add further sub-headings if you wish.

# 1. Introduction
Provide a brief overview of your report, explain the specific problem you are addressing, and why you think it is important.

# 2. Describing Your Problem Area
Explain in more detail what your problem is and how it involves different groups of stakeholders. Describe what stakeholders you engaged with during your project, why you chose them and what you learned about the needs and values of the relevant stakeholder groups. You do not need to give an exhaustive description of all the information you collected about the stakeholders. 

# 3. Your Design Idea
Describe the primary design idea that you developed. Justify **why** you developed this particular idea from among the range of options that you considered, and relate it to the problem area described in the previous section. What evidence do you have for the feasibility of this idea? Use appropriate techniques (e.g., tables, graphs, diagrams, photos) for communicating the information that supports your idea and for illustrating the idea itself, especially if the idea is primarily visual.  Data that provides evidence for your idea may include verbatim quotations or dialogues from focus groups and PD sessions. 
NB You can draw on any research or design exercises carried out within your team, not just information that you collected by yourself.

# 4. Evaluation and Next Steps
[10% - LO2]
What do you think needs to be done next in order to further develop your idea and perhaps bring about actual change? What additional evidence would you like to collect or what further user testing? It's possible that you think that the primary idea that you pursued should **not** be pursued further -- if so, explain your conclusions.

# 5. Reflections
[15% - LO4]
What has been your personal experience of working on this project? What was your personal contribution to the team effort during the Slow Hack?

# 6. Conclusions
[5%]
Summarise overall what you personally, and your team, have accomplished in
your project.  This part of your report should draw together the main threads
of your report. Try to emphasise four key 'take home' points for the reader.
